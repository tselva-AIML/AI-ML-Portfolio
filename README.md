# PGP AI/ML Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my AI/ML portfolio from the Post Graduate Program in AI/ML. This repository showcases projects demonstrating skills in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **EDA**, and **data preprocessing**. With 22 years of P&C insurance experience and certifications in **AWS AI Practitioner**, **Azure Data Scientist Associate**, **Duck Creek Policy Configurator**, and **Power BI Data Analyst**, I’m transitioning to an AI/ML Engineer role to solve claims, fraud, and underwriting challenges.

## Projects
1. **[Plant Seedling Classification](plant-seedling-classification/)**  
   Built a CNN model to classify plant seedlings (98% accuracy), adaptable for insurance document classification (e.g., claims photos).  
   **Skills**: TensorFlow, Keras, CNNs, image processing.  

2. **[Bank Customer Churn Prediction](bank-customer-churn/)**  
   Developed a neural network to predict customer churn (85% F1-score), applicable to P&C policyholder retention.  
   **Skills**: TensorFlow, Keras, EDA, Power BI Data Analyst.  

3. **[Credit Card Users Churn Prediction](credit-card-churn/)**  
   Created a Random Forest model with SMOTE for churn prediction, adaptable for claims fraud detection.  
   **Skills**: Scikit-learn, SMOTE, hyperparameter tuning. 

4. **[Personal Loan Campaign](personal-loan-campaign/)**  
   Built a Decision Tree model to predict loan uptake, applicable to P&C underwriting.  
   **Skills**: Scikit-learn, EDA.

5. **[FoodHub](foodhub/)**  
   Conducted EDA to derive business insights, adaptable for P&C customer analytics.  
   **Skills**: Pandas, Seaborn, Python Foundations.  

## About Me
I’m a Solutions Architect with 22 years in P&C insurance, specializing in SaaS implementations (Duck Creek) and digital transformation. Certified in **AWS**, **Azure**, **Duck Creek**, and **PMP**, I’m pursuing an MS in Computer Science to drive insurtech innovation.
