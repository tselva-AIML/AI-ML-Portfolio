# Plant Seedling Classification

## Overview
This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify plant seedlings and weeds, achieving **58.74% accuracy**. Developed as part of the PGP AI/ML program (March 2025), it demonstrates skills in **image processing**, **deep learning**, and **model evaluation**. In a **P&C insurance context**, this approach can be adapted for **claims document classification** (e.g., classifying damage photos in auto or property claims).

## Skills and Tools
- **Technologies**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Techniques**: CNNs, image preprocessing, data imbalance handling

## Data
The dataset consists of two files used to train and evaluate the CNN model:
- **`images.npy` (222 MB)**: A NumPy array containing preprocessed image data for plant seedlings and weeds.  
- **Download**: [[Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rl1enYZ_W9DbtQ3RaE2LplyQ7cMGKl56/view?usp=sharing) (Anyone with the link can download).  
- **Labels.csv**: Available in `data/` folder.
